# Study-Bot

Alright, to run the example program, just use this command:

```bash
flask --app wsgi run
```

This program is the rizz bot we were discussing earlier. This is just a temporary program to show you a little about FLASK

To actually use it, try adding a search prompt to the URL, like this:

> /api?search=Music
